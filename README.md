# Minerva-Neue-2.0
A modification to the MediaWiki Minerva Neue skin. Can be used on all MediaWiki projects, including Wikipedia.

## About
This skin is a modification of the existing Minerva Neue theme. It provides a sleek, modern interface that removes the clutter found in the default Vector theme. Some of its highlights include removing the sidebar and introducing a stuck header bar with beautiful translucency, a collapsible menu with simple options, a compact search UI, and a soft, rounded interface with an automatic dark mode.

## Installation on MediaWiki Projects
A Wikipedia or MediaWiki account is required to install. Before you begin, ensure you know your account username.

The gist: copy the CSS and JavaScript from the provided links and add to your own Custom CSS and JavaScript for the Minerva Neue theme, and then select the Minerva Neue theme as your main. More detailed steps are outlined below.

Check back periodically to see if the code has been updated. If so, follow the installation process again.

### Step One
Copy and paste the CSS from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natster101s/Minerva-Neue-2.0/master/minerva.css) into mediawiki.org/wiki/User:YOURUSERNAME/minerva.css and save changes. If it says that this page does not exist, click the edit button anyway and save changes. **For Wikipedia, change mediawiki.org to en.wikipedia.org.**

### Step Two
Copy and paste the JavaScript from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natster101s/Minerva-Neue-2.0/master/minerva.js) into mediawiki.org/wiki/User:YOURUSERNAME/minerva.js and save changes. If it says that this page does not exist, click the edit button anyway and save changes. **For Wikipedia, change mediawiki.org to en.wikipedia.org.**

*Please note, JavaScript is not necessary for the theme to function, but enhances the experience*

### Step Three
On a MediaWiki project, Wikipedia for example, navigate to User Preferences and Appearance. Select Minerva Neue as the theme, and then press save! Please note that this theme will only display when logged into your Wikipedia account.

## Changelog
Version 2.0: The code for this theme has been completely rewritten and is now much more efficient. It also includes a dark mode (currently experimental) that is toggled on or off in accordance with the settings of your operating system. macOS Mojave, iOS 13 and Windows 10 or higher are required. This feature also requires the latest version of Chrome, Safari or Firefox to be installed. 

Version 3.0: Includes an all new navigation bar at the top left that takes up less space.

Version 3.1: Includes a rebuilt collapsible navigation bar when scrolling that takes up even less space, and major bug fixes. Collapsible navigation bar can be turned off by removing JavaScript.

Version 3.2: Simple bug fixes

Version 4.0: Many bug fixes, including fixes for the Safari browser on Hi-DPI displays. Introduction of a new compact search UI.

*Please note that versions prior to 3.2 are not documented on this git*

## Bugs and Fixes
Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project!

For those who encounter bugs or issues without any coding experience, please create an Issue from the Issues tab, describe the bug, and we will do the best we can to fix it! You should come back periodically to check if your issue was resolved and the code has been updated.

Please note that the Dark Mode is experimental at this point, and some elements may not render correctly, especially when editing, but we're working on it! It is recommended at this point to turn off dark mode when editing. As well, we are aware of an issue where pages may take a little longer to load.
