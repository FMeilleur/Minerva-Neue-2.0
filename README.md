# Minerva-Neue-2.0
A modification to the MediaWiki Minerva Neue skin. Can be used on all MediaWiki projects, including Wikipedia.

## About
This skin is a modification of the existing Minerva Neue theme. It provides a sleek, modern interface that removes the clutter found in the default Vector theme. This theme removes the sidebar, introduces a stuck header bar with beautiful translucency, a collapsible menu with simple options, and a beautifully soft rounded interface.

## Installation on MediaWiki Projects

Copy the CSS and JavaScript from the provided links and add to your own Custom CSS and JavaScript for the Minerva Neue theme, and then select the Minerva Neue theme as your main. For example, add the CSS from mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Natster101/minerva.css to mediawiki.org/wiki/User:YOURUSERNAME/minerva.css and mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Natster101/minerva.js to mediawiki.org/wiki/User:YOURUSERNAME/minerva.js. **For Wikipedia, change mediawiki.org to en.wikipedia.org.**

## Changelog
