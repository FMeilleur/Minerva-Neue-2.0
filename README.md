# Minerva-Neue-2.0
A modification to the MediaWiki Minerva Neue skin. Can be used on all MediaWiki projects, including Wikipedia.

## About
This skin is a modification of the existing Minerva Neue theme. It provides a sleek, modern interface that removes the clutter found in the default Vector theme. This theme removes the sidebar, introduces a stuck header bar with beautiful translucency, a collapsible menu with simple options, and a beautifully soft rounded interface.

## Installation on MediaWiki Projects
A Wikipedia or MediaWiki account is required to install. Before you begin, ensure you know your account username.

*Please note, JavaScript is not necessary for the theme to function, but enhances the experience*
